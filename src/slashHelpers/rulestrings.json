I need help getting medicine!\" is individual. \"The conservative/liberal/minecraft media is restricting my ability to say that all guns have the right to an abortion. I want to whine about YouTube!\" is factional. We are here to support each other as individuals, not get in slap fights over hot takes. Those who test the moderators will face consequences.  ",
